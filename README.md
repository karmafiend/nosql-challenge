Repo for Chris Kilkes' Module #12 Data Analytics Bootcamp repository challenge - Chris Kilkes 04/29/24 @ 1:17 pm PST

# What the project does: 
Enables updating and analysis of the UK's Food Standards Agency database for restaurants, cafes and other British establishments to examine each establishment's food hygiene rating. The project has been commissioned by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love examining particular establishments, Local Authority Areas and the addition of an exciting new restaurant being added to the Agency's database for the first time ever.

# How users can get started with the project: 
Download, run analysis and evaluate results for self. Code allows for creation of new database and collection using PyMongo for this project allowing for the requested analyses from the editors of Eat Safe, Love magazine editors. 

# Resources used for building SQL project include:
Multiple sources such as: I referenced official Bootcamp course material and documentation; instructor teaching (classes & shared resources), aid from fellow students, Google Search, StackOverflow, W3C Schools, content as well as support and guidance from the Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT. In particular I spent the primary amount of my time reviewing the official MongoDB documentation located on its site here: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/pymongo/ especially around the areas of aggregation documentation as required by this exercise.
